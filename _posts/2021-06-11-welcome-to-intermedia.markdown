Hi there!

Founded in 1995, Intermedia is a cloud communications company that helps over 122,000 businesses connect better through voice, video conferencing, chat, contact center, business email and productivity, file sharing and backup, security, archiving, and more – all delivered through one highly reliable and secure platform. 

We are also proud to be the exclusive cloud communications platform provider for NEC, a leader in global market share for unified communications with 80+ million installed business phone users worldwide.

But what about the engineering side of our work? We have large development and engineering teams spread around the world working each day to create better and more efficient ways to help companies connect. Like most engineering teams, much of what we have developed through the years has involved a lot of trial and error, as well as learning from colleagues both inside and outside of our organization. You never know what will trigger a better way of doing things and that’s why we have launched this blog – to open a platform with the broader engineering and dev community to share ideas, to challenge, and to grow.

Here you will find insights on a wide range of topics, including mobile and full stack development, discussions around the DEV and QA processes, our open-source contributions, and even some amazing and amazingly bad stories from our engineering experience! It’s our intent and hope that this platform will serve to help engineers around the world learn something new, maybe resolve some complicated problem, or just have some interesting reading during breaks from coding:)

So, let’s get to it and dive right into our first topics:

- [Dealing with iOS 14 local network permission]({% post_url 2021-06-11-ios14-local-network %})
- [Resolving WebRTC compatibility issues between multiple dependencies]({% post_url 2021-06-11-webrtc-buildscript %})
